                <h3>As videogame lover...</h3>
                <p>I consider video games to be complete cultural works, which can captivate us with rich experiences of different art forms. I have enjoyed them since I was a child and I am committed to creating my own stories to captivate more people.</p>
                <p><span>Favourites videogames: </span>Red Dead Redemption 2, Ultrakill, Bloodborne, Hollow Knight and Cult of the Lamb.</p>

                <h3>As developer...</h3>
                <p>Organization, simplicity, and clean code are the most important things to me, so it's something I try to improve. I like learning to solve patterns in a simple way, finding efficient solutions, and reinforcing principles and good practices in my knowledge.</p>
                <p><span>Dev tools: </span>Visual Studio Code, Vue, Django, Bootstrap, Godot Engine, Pixi.js</p>

                <h3>As artist (well, future artist)...</h3>
                <p>I have a clear tendency towards pixel-art and every day I take a step closer to perfecting this beautiful and complex technique. As in any creative discipline, the process of improvement is continuous, and there is always a long way to go.</p>
